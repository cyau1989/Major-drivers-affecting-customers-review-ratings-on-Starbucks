# Major-drivers-affecting-customers-review-ratings-on-Starbucks

This report aims to investigate the major drivers affecting customers’ review ratings on Starbucks (and on Dunkin’ Donuts as a comparison) based on Yelp Dataset Challenge 2017 (https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge), with focus on textual analysis on the review and tip generated by customers. Panel linear model with location clustering as index is used as the main model with comparison from ordinary least squares (OLS), Rpart, Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Boosted Regression Models (GBM). The main model gives R2=0.662. Variables are derived from methodologies including k-means clustering, dictionary approach, topic modelling (by Latent Dirichlet Allocation), text classification (by SVM and Random Forest). Main model has been further enhanced via various imputation methods of missing values. The insights revealed in this report lead to several recommendations which not only be useful for Starbuck’s management, but also other food chain affiliations.

Key Words: PLM, RF, OLS, Rpart, GBM, SVM, LDA, K-mean clustering, Word Cloud, Dictionary approach, topic modeling, text classification
